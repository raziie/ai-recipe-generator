## 🧠 AI Model Integration

The app supports generating recipes via different AI models:

- **Hugging Face Inference API** – Uses [`mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1`](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1) to generate creative recipe responses based on user-input ingredients.
- **(Optional)** Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku – Code is included but commented out by default. Easily switch between models by uncommenting the relevant section and providing your API key.

### System Prompt

All model calls include a consistent system prompt to ensure markdown formatting and focused, useful recipe suggestions:

```
You are an assistant that receives a list of ingredients that a user has and suggests a recipe they could make with some or all of those ingredients...
```

### 🔐 Environment Variables

Be sure to define your API keys:

```env
VITE_HF_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_token
```

Update your `.env` file or environment settings accordingly.
